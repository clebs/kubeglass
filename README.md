**NOTE:** This program only works with kubernetes versions 1.28+.

## Description
KubeGlass allows to compare 2 kubernetes versions and see what changed on the different APIs between them.

## Installation
Run `go install github.com/clebs/kubeglass`.

## Usage
To compare 2 kubernetes versions run `kubeglass --from=1.28 --to=1.29`. This will show the following output:
